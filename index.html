        <h3>Baton Twirling</h3>
        <p>Baton twirling is a sport involving the manipulation of a metal rod and the human body to a coordinated routine and is similar to rhythmic gymnastics or color guard (flag spinning). Twirling combines dance, agility, coordination, Flexibility gymnastics, and many more while manipulating a single baton or multiple batons. It is primarily performed with the accompaniment of music. Fundamental characteristics of the sport include the handling of the baton to create visual images, pictures, and patterns executed with dexterity both close in and around the body and the proper release of the baton into the air. The discipline requires the simultaneous blending of these fundamental characteristics, utilizing time and space to display both technical merit and artistic expression. There are multiple types baton twirlers. A featured twirler at a college or high school can be called a feature twirler. Majorettes twirl in a group for a high school or college. Another type of twirler is part of a group that does local parades and performances. Finally, competitive twirlers can compete as a part of a group or as a soloist. Twirlers can start at the early age of 2 to high school aged.<p/>

        <p>The sport of baton requires specific knowledge of how to manipulate the baton and where to hold the baton. The baton can be described as a metal rod, but that would be too simplistic of a description. The baton has two rubber ends that attach to the ends of the metal rod. On one end, there is a large tip that is called the ball. On the other end, there is a small tip simply called the tip. The baton is balanced slightly off center to allow for proper rolling. The rod can be one of several thicknesses depending on preference. Thicker, heavier rods are better for rolling, while thinner ones are better for finger rolls. The rubber ends can have different designs or weights depending on the manufacturer. Common types are the star, tulip and simple round tips. The length is the baton from tip to tip should be one inch longer than the distance from the arm pit to the tip of the middle finger. The baton is manipulated from three positions depending on the trick. The positions are from the ball, one hand from the tip, and mostly from the center of the baton. The rod of the baton can be decorated with tape, grip tape added, or left without tape. The tape can be anything from electrical tape to tennis tape.</p>

        <p>Baton twirling requires skillful coordination and extraordinary control of the human body. Additionally it requires a great amount of flexibility in order to properly execute baton, dance, and gymnastics elements. Choreography for baton twirling is designed to promote expression of the body through dance and movement to create a demonstration of strength, flexibility, physical fitness, beauty, aesthetics, and harmony in coordination with the manipulation of the baton.</p>

        <p>The foundation of baton twirling is the thumb toss. This trick is accomplished from the middle of the baton. The baton is held in one hand at the waist. The baton is rolled over the thumb and a slight hand movement lifts it into the air. The thumb toss can be increased in difficultly with 1 or more spins done under the toss, cartwheels, front walkovers, illusions or many more tricks. The baton can be tosses from either hand, but proficiency in both hands is preferable. The baton can be caught blind behind the head, at the side, under a kick, under one or both legs or in an illusion. Other tosses include the open hand toss and flat spin toss.</p>

        <h3>It's History</h3>
        <p>Baton twirling started in Western Europe and Asia. It is thought it started at dance festivals where the goers used knives, rifles, torches and sticks to twirl with and toss. The sport progressed into the armies of some countries which twirled with rifles during marches. When the army was parading, they added a rifle twirler to the front of the marchers. The rifle was then switched for a "mace". The mace was much larger than the batons of today and imbalanced. They are still used by some marching bands at parades nowadays. The mace barer or "drum major" twirled the baton whilst leading the army or band. The maces were altered for easier twirling and now resemble the batons. They were given smaller ends of light rubber, made from hollow light metal and balanced to give accuracy to the twirler. It is thought it was the involvement of females ("drum majorettes") and the progression of twirling that prompted the lightening and balancing of the baton.[2] The sport came to North America when Major Reuben Webster Millsaps created baton twirling when he established Millsaps College in Mississippi after the Civil War.</p>

        <p>While many member countries have their own national organizations, at the world level, three governing bodies are recognized: the <a href="http://www.wbtf.org">World Baton Twirling Federation (WBTF)</a>, the <a href="http://www.worldtwirling.cc">World Twirling Association (WTA)</a>. The WBTF and NBTA host World Championships and International Cup (WBTF), while the WTA continues to honor the origins of the sport with additional events that WBTF does not include.</p>

        <p>Established in 1977, the World Baton Twirling Federation was formed to develop, encourage, and standardize the sport. In October 1979, the Federation representatives met in Paris, France to finalize all plans for the first World Championships, bringing together teams of twirlers from ten countries to compete in a spirit of healthy, athletic competition. The United States Twirling Association, Inc. hosted the first World Championships in Seattle, Washington in 1980. Each successive year, one member country has hosts the championships in August.</p>
